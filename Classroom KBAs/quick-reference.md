# Classroom Quick Reference
*This article is for teachers.*  

Welcome to Classroom, your digital education platform. Classroom has all the tools you need to organize your classes, manage assignments, and communicate with students and parents. 

## Getting Around  
Classroom is organized with a toolbar at the top and navigation drawer on the left. The toolbar is a global feature that is pinned at the top of the window, so it’s always accessible no matter where you are on the platform. 

The active page is displayed on the right. 

**Tip:**
* Click Menu <img src="menu.png" width="16" height="16"> to expand or minimize the navigation drawer.
