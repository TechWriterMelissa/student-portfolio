### I’m not receiving notifications when my students submit their work?

**Problem**  
In Google Classroom, email notifications are enabled by default for comments, assignment submissions, and posts. You should be receiving notifications when your students send you messages or comments, and when they submit work for grading. If you are not receiving email notifications, there could be an issue with your settings or it could be a browser issue.  

**Solution**  
First, check your spam folder. 

Next, you’ll want to check your Google Classroom settings.

1. Go to classroom.google.com
2. From the Menu, click settings.
3. Ensure “Allow email notifications” is toggled ON

If the issue is still not resolved, try the following:

* Clear your browser’s cache.
* Sign out and then sign in to your Google account on your browser.
* Sign out and then sign in to Classroom. 
* Try using a different browser.

>**Sometimes notifications are set at the school level.** If you’re still not receiving notifications, check with your school’s Google Workspace administrator.
