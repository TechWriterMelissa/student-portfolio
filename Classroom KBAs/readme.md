## Docs as Code - Knowledge Base Articles Assignment
The following work was completed as part of a student project at Our Best Words. 

### The Assignment
1. Choose one application: WhatsApp or Google Classroom.
2. Write 5 KBAs, one of each type (5 in total)
    * Informational
    * How-to
    * Referential 
    * Troubleshooting
    * FAQ  (2 or more questions)

### Process
I chose Google Classroom since I already had some direct experience using the tool. I decided to create a mock Classroom with the persona of a singing instructor. I played around in the platform, and tried to think about how a singing instructor might use the tool and what kinds of questions might come up. Then I spent some time reviewing Google's existing help materials for tone, structure, and overall look and feel so that I could tailor my work roughly to their style guide. For the troubleshooting article, I searched what I thought might be a common problem (notifications) and read through answers on several community message boards. 

### User Persona
Marie is an experienced performer and recording artist who offers vocal coaching both online and in-person at her home-based studio. She comes from an earlier generation that did most of their communicating in person and over the phone, and she sometimes struggles to navigate new technology. She is easily frustrated by technology at times, and needs things to be explained in a simple way or she gets overwhelmed. Despite these struggles, Marie recognizes the value of technology for her business and wants to learn to use tools that can help improve her students' experience.
