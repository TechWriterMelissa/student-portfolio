# Glossary for Game Development
This glossary includes a few basic terms one might encounter as a Technical Writer working in the Video Game Development space. It was created in Markdown as part of a student project at [Our Best Words](https://ourbestwords.com/).

## A
<dl>
<dt>	Asset	</dt>	
   <dd>	An asset is any data file used in a video game, as opposed to code. For example, images, sound or music files, 3D models (i.e., characters or environments), and dialog.   	</dd>
</dl>

## C
<dl>
<dt>	Collision	</dt>	
   <dd>	In a video game, a collision occurs when two or more objects intersect, interact with, or come into the proximity of one another within a certain threshold. 	</dd>
</dl>

## G
<dl>
<dt>	Game Design Document (GDD)	</dt>	
   <dd>	A game design document, or GDD, is a dynamic and detailed planning document, usually created by video game developers or a development team. It is used in the early stages of game development as part of a pitch to, or shortly after the game is commissioned by, a publisher. The GDD guides the development team as they build the game and is generally considered a "living document" that changes as development progresses. It describes the game's concept, technical design, user interface, artwork and story elements, as well as target audience and selling points. </dd>
<dt>	Game Engine	</dt>	
   <dd> A suite of software tools for video game developers, often provided in an integrated development environment. Tools and features vary across game engines but generally include graphics rendering, a physics engine, artificial intelligence capabilities, and sound as well as animation engines. Game engine software's pre-built framework supports faster, more efficient game development.   </dd>
<dt>	Games User Research (GUR)	</dt>	
   <dd>	The study of video game players (users), their playing behavior, and their perceptions about a game in order to optimize the player experience. Techniques include subjective methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, but more frequently focus on objective data derived from playtesting and analytics.  	</dd>
</dl>

## L
<dl>
<dt>	Localization	</dt>	
   <dd>	Video game localization is the process of making a game accessible to a particular market or demographic. Localization can be translation of the game's assets into another language, or it might involve revision of the content to suit a particular age group.	</dd>
</dl>

## P
<dl>
<dt>	Playtesting	</dt>	
   <dd>	A set of techniques and tools used to capture and analyze a player's thoughts, behavior, actions, and body language during video gameplay. Playtesting is the process of collecting feedback about a video game from players so developers can resolve any bugs or design flaws prior to the game's release.  	</dd>
<dt> Prototyping </dt> 
<dd>	Creating an early, stripped down version (or versions) of a video game's design to explore ideas, identify issues, and decide whether a concept is viable before committing it to development.  	</dd>
</dl>

## S
<dl>
<dt>	Script	</dt>	
   <dd>	A video game script is a written story that outlines the plot, characters, scenes, dialog, and everything a player will encounter while playing the game. (Note: Game scripting also means writing code or programming).	</dd>
   
## U
<dl>
<dt>	Usability Heuristics	</dt>	
   <dd>	Usability refers to the interaction between a user and a product, and the degree to which that interaction is easy and satisfying. In gaming, usability heuristics are principles or rules of thumb used by game designers to ensure a game's user interface is intuitive, enjoyable and creates an excellent player experience.   	</dd>
